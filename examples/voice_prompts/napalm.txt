Fire in weaponized form is the most effective weapon there is with the sole exception of the nuke. The only thing scarier than fire are chemical/bio weapons, but those are hard to control and can have severe consequences on the whole region. Napalm on the other hand can be dropped wherever we need it and within a few hours it will extinguish by itself once there's nothing else left to fuel it.
